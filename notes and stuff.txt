Notes: consider expanding max/min def to more than 7 day span, maybe 10/15?
       consider making a formula
       consider scanning for patterns before huge runs, commonalities. Perhaps can weed out patterns or formations
		that don't go anywhere.

Steps:
1) Find/make intersection w/ stock plot and w/ line method/function.
	a) intersection with stock plot will be buy/sell trigger
	b) returns boolean
2) Calculate slopes and eqtns for any two points
	a) if eqtn intersects with stock plot AT TIME AFTER X2 then throw out
	b) else add to list
3) Make a function/method that combines any trendlines that are similar
	a) similarity defined as Y difference at same X
4) Make a function/method that finds any intersection w/trendlines in last 5 days.
	a) consider filtering out stocks that cross the trendline with a low slope. F
	   find best fit linear regression for last 10 days and slope must exceed some number.
5) Make a function/method screener.
	a) Scans for different patterns and stuff.
